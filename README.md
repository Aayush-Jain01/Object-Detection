# Object-Detection
This repo is an ongoing self-project based on Car Object Detection Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)

Key Highlights :-

(1) Learnt about different object detection models and experimented with them, finally chose Faster-RCNN

(2) Used Data Augmentations to prevent Over Fitting

(3) Transfer Learning

(4) Mean Average Precision metric 

(5) Hyper Parameter Tuning for better accuracy
